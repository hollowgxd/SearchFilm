# Movie App called SearchFilm
This Movie app uses MovieDb as API, you can sort films by genres, also you can search films by title. In this app I've combined some axios requests and made typization, all movies have their info pages. Currently working on likes, video player, fixes, new preloaders. Also check responsible background made by Particle ts!

Important info: this api don't work with russian ip, so if you want to fetch films use VPN/PROXY
